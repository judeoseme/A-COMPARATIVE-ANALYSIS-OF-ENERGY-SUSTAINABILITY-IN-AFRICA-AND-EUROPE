# A-COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-ENERGY-SUSTAINABILITY-IN-AFRICA-AND-EUROPE

Energy sustainability is the practice of using energy in a way that meets the needs and demands of the present without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their own needs. This could be done by utilizing the resource of energy efficiently that do not deplete the Earth’s natural resources or causing environmental harm. In today’s contemporary society, there is a growing concern about energy sustainability. The demand for energy cannot be over-emphasized.  This is because energy is essential part of our everyday lives. All living creatures depends so much on energy directly or indirectly for its survival, growth, and development. There are varieties of ways in which energy sustainability can be achieved. One major way is to use energy resources that are renewable such as geothermal power, wind power, solar power. It is pertinent to note that these energy sources cause little or emission of carbon dioxide (Green House Emission) to the environment which is a major cause of climate change. Another way energy sustainability could be achieved is to make energy-efficiency appliances such as vehicles, buildings to perform same task with less energy. This article will tend to look at the comparative analysis of energy sustainability in Africa and European nation. Africa is mostly affected by climate change where a large population of the region are without access to clean fuels for cooking causing unnecessary havoc and delay in the continent’s economic growth and development. Most Africa countries are depended solely on energy produced from fossil fuels such as gas, coal, petroleum. However, it is important to note that the amount of carbon dioxide (Co2) being released in the atmosphere could result to global warming issues. Access to clean energy services has been a major challenge facing the Africa continent. For instance, In Nigeria, about 70% of the entire population are without access to electricity which has led to a massive decline in the growth and development of the country. However, this could be averted if the right skills are being employed. According to I.M Bugaje in his review of renewable energy for sustainability in Africa described the length at which policies on wind power, solar power is meeting up with the sustainability development in Africa. Therefore, societies call for the services of energy to meet basic human needs like health, cooking and serves as a generative process (Edenhofer et al., 2011). Energy sources like geothermal, wind energy, biomass energy, etc. is clean and sustainable. This alternative energy solution is clean and do not release gases that are harmful to the atmosphere. 
The objective of this study is:
1. To recommend best practices for underdeveloped nations. 
2. To assess the socio-economic benefits of sustainable energy development.
3. To add to existing knowledge of energy sustainability

BACKGROUND RESEARCH:
Exploration of the current state of the art in the design of interactive dashboards with references to appropriate works.

A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated, and arrange on a single screen so the information can be monitored on a single screen. (Stephen Few; 2006). By mere looking at it, one should be able to communicate the information on a dashboard. Over the years, there have been a significant change in the design of an interactive dashboard. This important change has been because of advancement in technology and data visualization technique. These has led to a more effective and user-friendly design. A major pattern in the design of an interactive dashboard is the use of filters and drilldowns. These are interactive element that gives the user the opportunity to describe the data in a more detailed way. The advantage of this is that it helps the users to gain a clear understanding and perception of the decision to make. Another development in the design of an interactive dashboard is the use of responsive design principle. This is all about the dashboard being able to adjust to varieties of screen sizes. They also allow users to communicate with different devices such as desktop computers, laptop etc. Also, another current movement seen in interactive dashboard design is the application of data visualization technique is the ability to use graphs and charts to display data that are quite complicated.  In a nutshell, the current state of the art in the design of an interactive dashboard is based on applying data visualization techniques, interactive element, to create dashboard that are accessible, well driven information as well as user-friendly. Some of the references to appropriate works include:
1.Edward Tufte: Envisioning Information, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, and Beautiful Evidence : 
2.A handbook for data driven design written by Andy kirk 2016 
3.Effective visual communication of data by Stephen Few 2006. He provided advice on how to design dashboards in industry. He also listed some mistakes people make and sums up the most relevant ideas at any field.
Dashboard are designed and employed by nearly every industry, non-profit, and service organization to support well informed data decision making. They are used by students to aid learning, and by individuals to monitor energy consumption and personal health. In today’s world of business, Dashboard has been used to manage data, prepare data, analyse data, interpret data, and allow people to have a better understanding of the situation being represented on a dashboard. Before now there have been a traditional approach to represents graphical information. For instance, statics map is unable to provide clear and well-defined graphical representation to overview (Andrienko,  2010).  However, over the years, Dashboard has gained a huge popularity to communicate information effectively and as such the above traditional approaches to represent a graphical information can be done in a dashboard environment since it contains various type of graphical representation. It is no longer news that dashboard has being deployed to be use in various sectors of the economy.  (Pauwels et al., 2009). According to krush. M.T et al., (2013) talked about the use of marketing dashboard to highlight the sales and marketing operations. In the field of public health, Lechner and Fruhling (2014) opined that a possible outbreak of diseases can be monitored through a designed digital dashboard of the summarized public health data. In education, Maldonado, Kay, Yacef, Schwendimann (2012), are of the view that teachers could use dashboard to summarise student data, to monitor student learning effectively and to support collaborative learning. According to Few (2006), the most important way to categorise dashboard is depended on its role. It can be categorised into strategic, analytical, Operational.
COMPOSITON LAYOUT AND DESIGN OF A SINGLE SCREEN DASHBOARD:
When we say a single screen dashboard, we are simply talking about varieties of different type of visuals such as maps, graphs, etc that are being set out or organize in a manner that will allow users to quickly to have a clear and precise understanding of the information being represented on a dashboard. These cannot be achieved without a proper consideration and understanding of the composition, layout, and design. Talking about the composition, it simply means the elements that are being included in the dashboard. The element that must be included must be a vital data. Adding unnecessary data will cause confusion. Layout refers to the proper fixing and organization of those element. This means using a clean design that makes it easier for the user to have clear understanding of the dashboard. It should be arranged in a way that it is logical and easy to find your way about.  Lastly, the design is an important factor that could have a huge impact on the dashboard. Considering the use of colours as well as typography will improve the readability and clarity of the dashboard.  
EXPLORATION OF DATASET:
Data exploration involves analysing the data to understand its content. This involves a clear evaluation of its pattern as well as examining the relationship between variables. Exploring a dataset is an iterative one where analysing it will lead to further processing. The dataset used for this study is gotten from the ‘World Bank Data’. The indicator used is the ‘Sustainable Energy for All’.  A total of 15 countries were selected for this study. Africa region was classified as underdeveloped nations are:
1.	Algeria

1.	I kept record of the trends where the error was coming from. By so doing I was able to identify and fix the incorrect data.
2.	The process of data entry was standardized to reduce the duplicate copy.
3.	Validation of data accuracy was carried out to ensure the structure and the content of data files are well understood.
4.	I scrub to remove duplicate copies of data. This is necessary to avoid repetition of data entries which could make it difficult to read when visualizing. Also identifying duplicate copies can help save time when analysing your data.
Also, the following were done
5.	Select the ‘country name’ column. On the transform tab, select ‘format’, then select ‘uppercase’.
6.	Let’s Shorten the following column name
  Double click ‘access to clean fuels and technologies (% of total population)’ and rename it to ‘access to clean fuels’.
  Double click ‘access to electricity (% of total population) and rename it to ‘access to electricity’
7.	The following columns were repeated so I had to delete one.
	Country code: On the country code, right click to remove column
	Time code: on the time code, right click to remove column.
8.	Select the following columns below in decimal number and changed to whole number.

9.	In the country name column, select the dropdown and clear the box next to null
10.	On the home tab, select close and apply.

Investigation of Data Workflows & Proposal for Design of Dashboard:
A dashboard is a graphical visual interface that allows users or public to monitor and interact various data sources. Before a dashboard can be designed to be used effectively, it is important you understand the mapping of data attributes to the right visuals.  Mapping of data attributes to a visual form in a dashboard environment is a very important factor to consider in data visualization. In this era of big data, huge amount of data requires the development of theoretical models that helps us to understand the need to effectively manage data collection and representation. Marr (2016) talked about the significant of visualization, emphasizing that it plays a major role in the build-up of data project. The first step in this process is to recognize the key data attributes that needs to be displayed. Before this can be done it is important you have a discussion with the organization as regard to their goals and objectives. Once this have been achieved, you can proceed to the type of visuals to use.  This selection could be based on the type of data and what message or information it tries to pass out to the user. Being able to identify the key data attributes will enable you to select the appropriate visuals. This process of mapping of data attributes involves been able to select the right visuals forms that aligns with the data. The type of data could be qualitative or quantitative. If the data attribute is a quantitative value, using a bar chart or line graph to illustrate this will be suited to analyse the percentage of loss or profit made in a marketing environment. In a contrast, if the data is a qualitative value otherwise known as a categorical value (One in which the variable categories are not describes as values or number but are based on verbal groupings). A pie chart will be most suited for this. For instance, to check the educational level of student, race, sex etc. Apart from choosing the right visual for the selected data attribute, it is important you consider the composition, layout, and design (colour). All these have been discussed above as this will make the dashboard easy to understand. Dashboard are design based on what you want to interpret to the public.  For example, if you want to show the overall performance of students in a school, a visualization that emphasizes on high level patterns in the data may be appropriate. This could be done using a combination line graph bar charts to show the key metrics However, if the dashboard is intended to show information about a particular student, a visual paradigm that emphasizes drilldown and exploration of the data will be appropriate. In summary, the selection of a visual paradigm should depend on understanding of the data, specific goals, and objective of the dashboard. Once the analysis workflows have been done, the next step to take is to combine each individual data analysis into a single and coherent visual representation. Formulating Individual workflows into a single and coherent visual representation will allow the public to understand the most significant information presented on the dashboard. In this study, the countries chosen for this dataset are 10 African countries plus 5 European countries. 
The columns consist up of the following
1.	Access to clean fuels for cooking: This includes electricity, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, solar and alcohol fuels.

2.	Renewable Electricity output: This is the electric output of power plant using renewable resources, including wind, solar PV, solar thermal, hydro, marine, geothermal, solid biofuels, renewable municipal waste, liquid biofuels, and biogas. Electricity production from hydro pimped storage is excluded. 

3.	Renewable electricity share of total electricity output: This is the electricity generated by power plants using renewable resources as a share of total electricity output.

4.	Renewable energy consumption: This indicator includes energy consumption from all renewable resources: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine, and waste.

5.	Renewable energy share of total final electricity consumption: Share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption.

6.	Total electricity output: This is the total number of electricity generated by all power plants.


7.	Total final energy consumption: This indicator was derived from energy balances statistics and is equivalent to total final consumption excluding non-energy use.

8.	Access to electricity: This indicator is the percentage of total population with access to electricity.
 
9.	Country names (Groups); This indicator is grouped into developed nations and the underdeveloped nations.
After a careful understanding of this data attributes along with the specific goals and objectives, I decided to design a dashboard to enable me to present it visually to the users. The following are the list of visuals that was designed in the dashboard environment. 

Visualization 1: This is a group of countries subdivided into developed and underdeveloped nations. For the developed nations we have France, Germany, Portugal, Russia Federation, and the United Kingdom. For the underdeveloped nations, we have Algeria, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Angola, Guinea Zambia, Ethiopia, Mali
 
Visualization 2: This is consisting of the year from 2000 to 2014. Each year when clicked will correspond to the country as well as with the different visualization. 
 
Visualization 3: This is a stacked column chart with the country name on the x-axis, and the sum of access to electricity on the y-axis forming the stacked bar. If you select the underdeveloped nations or developed nations and select any of the year, you will observe that only Algeria has got an 100% access to electricity from 2000-2014, while the rest African countries have got a significantly low access to electricity. if you select the developed and select any of the year, you will notice that the 5 European countries have 100% access to electricity. 
                 
Visualization 4: This is a pie chart with the country name on legend and the total units consumed on the values column. If you select the developed or underdeveloped nations and select any of the year, you will see the total unit consumed for each year in each country. 
      
Visualization 5: This is a line graph with the country name on the x-axis, and the sum of access to clean fuels for cooking on the y-axis. If you select the underdeveloped nations and select any of the year, you will observe that only Algeria has got a high percentage of clean fuels, while that of the developed nations, all the European countries have got an 100% access to clean fuels
         
Visualisation 6:  This is a stacked column chart with the country name on the x-axis and sum of total energy consumption on the y-axis. If you select the underdeveloped nation and select any of the year, you will observe that Nigeria has got the highest unit consumed while that of the developed nations, France and Russia has got the highest unit consumed.
            
Visualization 7:  Forcasting was applied in this visual with the year on the x axis and sum of total electricity output.

DISCUSSION:
Dashboard is a very powerful data-based intelligence using data visualization that helps to facilitate relevant data display. They have been introduced in modern life as a key tool for performance management. Considering the growing analytical functions dashboard facilitates, they continue to accelerate beyond the capabilities of a mere display.

Energy sustainability was well defined and assessed with 10 Africa countries and 5 European nations along with the variables. Africa is a rapidly growing population and the most urbanizing region. The energy deficit needs to be addressed if Africa economies are to develop. Africa energy needs are growing very fast raising the concern to invest in infrastructure and energy technologies that can power socio, economic and industrial growth sustainably. The future of energy sustainability particularly in Africa can yield a sustainable benefit through the incorporation of sustainable energy solution. This study describes sustainability energy, its socio-economic impact, methods and technologies that can be used to enhance sustainable energy development. It is pertinent to note that Africa is one of the largest populations in the world today and also with human capital intensive will definitely experience massive growth in all areas of the economy ranging from education, healthcare, access to basic public services and also employability among others. Africa need and have a right to more consumer electricity use, more transportation, more energy input to agriculture and manufacturing. This can be greatly achieved if the right skills of energy sustainability are being employed by adopting energy sustainability.
